# Amazon Product Review Analysis 📊

This is my first-ever data analysis project as part of the **DSA Data Analysis Capstone**.  
The goal is to analyze product data from Amazon to discover trends, customer behaviors, and product performance.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboard Design)

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered
1. What is the average discount % by category?
2. What is the total number of reviews per category?
3. Which products have the highest ratings?
4. What’s the potential revenue by category?
5. How many products have fewer than 1000 reviews?
6. Which categories offer the biggest discounts?

And more total of **14 business questions** answered using Excel!

## 📌 Insights
- Products with high ratings are not always the most discounted.
- Product categories like "Electronics" and "Home Appliances" have the highest potential revenue, even if the discounts are lower.
- A large number of products have very few reviews (under 1000), which shows sellers may need better marketing or customer engagement.
